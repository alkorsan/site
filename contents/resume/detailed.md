<details open><summary>The W3C typically works around specifications with its members. The [WebPlatform Docs project](http://www.webplatform.org) was meant to become an independent Web Developer documentation site maintained by an International community of contributors. Sponsors were: Adobe, Apple, DreamHost, Fastly, Facebook, Google, Intel, Mozilla, Microsoft, Nokia, and Opera.

My role was to maintain stability, improve features, strengthen the infrastructure of the site, and act as a technical liaison with Open-source communities.</summary>

#### Achievements

* **Convert content and history of MediaWiki into Static site-generator and Git** (2015)

    In order to preserve the contributions made by the community and allow the site to run only from static HTML files, I had to find a way to simplify server setup. To achieve this, I created a conversion system with which I could convert each wiki page into a text file,  preserve history for each save into a *git commit*.

    I could successfully rebuild WebPlatform Docs pages, content and history from MediaWiki that was using more than 25 <abbr title="Virtual Machines">VMs</abbr> into one Web server that serves simple static HTML files. Without losing the ability for the community to continue contributing to the documentation.

    *See the code*, refer to [Selected projects](#content-converter) section below.

*  **Infrastructure deployment code** (2015)

    The site relied on a number of Open-Source projects, written in different languages (PHP, Python, etc.) and managed by their own communities. Each component had a set of adjustments to maintain the "look and feel". Each Web application and configuration management scripts wasn’t originally made to support multiple deployment (e.g. staging, local), but only the live site.

    I successfully reworked the whole configuration management system such that we could clone each Web application code, apply their respective customization and configurations systematically. So we could rebuild the whole system from scratch, from any domain name, at any time.

    *See the code*, refer to [Selected projects](#webplatform-ops) section below.

*  **Self-healing monitoring** (2015)

    WebPlatform Docs server infrastructure had *no monitoring*, only a server health dashboard (*Ganglia*). I therefore set deployment code configuring *Monit* automatically for each service and VMs to ensure they remain up, and restart faulty services if they stopped running.

* **Implement Single Sign-On using OAuth2** (2014)

   The site was using multiple web applications such as WordPress, The BugGenie, MediaWiki, Discourse, and many others. Each section of the site would require to create an account manually. The objective was to set in place a system that takes care of storing *user profile data* and their *session state* using Mozilla Firefox Accounts.

   *See the code*, refer to [Selected projects](#webplatform-sso) section below.

* **Web Browser feature compatibility tables** (2014)

   Participate in making a web crawler to *get a local copy* of compatibility data stored within [Mozilla’s MDN](http://developer.mozilla.org/) content pages and clean it up to generate new compatibility tables within WebPlatform Docs. The project included a generated HTML cache system to prevent heavy server use caused by the feature.

* **Gift exchange interactive game** <small>(2010-2011)</small>

    Evocatio’s main business partner, <span lang="fr">RED l’Agence</span>, wanted to make an interactive Christmas Holiday wish card with their clients and partners. The game had been run two consecutive years and received prizes of recognition from the local marketing agency community («<span lang="fr">Grenier aux nouvelles</span>»).

    * *2010*: 40 different gifts, 40 participants

        Each participant could pick somebody else’s gift, with a limit of 9 picks. At a given time, participants learn which gift they were assigned. Whether or not they picked it. See this [article on my blog showcasing the 2010 variant](https://renoirboulanger.com/blog/2010/02/realisation-dune-application-dechange-de-cadeau-avec-red-lagence-le-%C2%ABclub-echangiste%C2%BB-2009/) (in French)

* **An "Offline-First" news reader in HTML5 for iPad** <small>(2010)</small>

    Objective was to allow site visitors to read articles offline from the iPad during transit periods. Project stated that it only had to support *Apple iPad*. The source site was running WordPress and therefore already had an <abbr title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr> feed. The site had been built using JavaScript templating library of the time and was assuming the Web browser supported HTML5’s <tt>localStorage</tt> such that upon loading the page, articles were kept locally and displayed. The project was a success, even though AppCache implementation in Safari at that time wasn’t complete.

### Implement Single Sign-On using OAuth2

Project
:    WebPlatform Docs

Sponsor
:    W3C/MIT

Technologies
:    <span class="label label-info">Mozilla Firefox Accounts</span> <span class="label label-info">Express.js</span> <span class="label label-info">Backbone.js</span> <span class="label label-info">OAuth2</span> <span class="label label-info">JavaScript</span>

<details><summary>As previously said, *WebPlatform.org* relied on a number of Open-Source projects, written in different languages. We wanted to simplify authentication, and had to create a way to share session state between different stacks.

In order to allow users to use *one set of credentials* on separate web applications, [I developed a mechanism to implement a Single Sign On][fxa-how] using [Mozilla Firefox Accounts][wpd-fxa-fork]. My work [caught attention of the Accounts team at Mozilla][mozillan-renoirb], but [hasn’t been merged yet][fxa-pr].</summary>

The objective has been achieved, but isn't in use because we migrated WebPlatform [into a static site-generator driven](#content-converter) publishing and no longer support any backends.

#### Requirements
* Possibility for a configured web application to get user session and data associated to a shared token from an authoritative server
* Possibility for a configured web application to either use or create a user locally and start a session
* Possibility for a configured web application to drop a local session if authoritative source doesn’t find a valid session
* Implement HTTP calls from relier backend to initiate roundtrip check to authoritative server
* Implement HTTP response from relier backend to confirm status of check

### Improve offline use <br/>on a prototyping tool

Project
:    [RoughDraft.js](https://github.com/renoirb/roughdraft.js)

Sponsor
:    Volunteer

Technologies
:    <span class="label label-info">JavaScript</span>

:    [Mockup of my wedding RSVP Web site](https://sweetieandsweetie.com/styleguide/)

<details><summary>RoughDraft allows to create HTML documents without any backend — All in the browser!. It makes it possible to create  simple static HTML files with loops, "*Lorem Ipsum*" and placeholder images without having to copy paste boilerplate code.</summary>

#### Contributions

* **Class name sequence generator** ([PR #9](https://github.com/ndreckshage/roughdraft.js/pull/9 "Pull Request"))

    When creating loops in a case where the pattern has to have predetermined class names. For example, `<ul><li class="foo-alfa" data-draft-repeat="3" data-draft-text="1/w"></li></ul>` would generate a list with three *Lorem Ipsum* words, each list item would be named `foo-alfa`, `foo-bravo`, `foo-charlie`

* **Improve offline use support** ([PR #14](https://github.com/ndreckshage/roughdraft.js/pull/14 "Pull Request"))

    Few additions to speed up load time. Ability to use inline SVG images and instead of using external placeholder image providers.
